# Wine_Quality_Prediction-Python
Predicting the quality of wine using Supervised Learning

Problem Statement: The dataset contains red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

The goal is to predict the quality score of wine (between 0 to 10 range) as low, medium or high

Data Description:

There are 13 variables with 6497 records:

Attribute Information: The data set includes information about:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 â€“ alcohol
12- Wine_Type (red or wine)
Output variable (based on sensory data):

13 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
